@devprog/todo-list
===============================================

This is a fairly barebones todo list component that uses the httpEffect, input, buttons, and a subcomponent to build a (not very pretty) todo list. You can create new, complete, and cancel todos from the component. 

The component works with a simple todo list app found here: [github.com/bradtiltonnow/simple-todo](https://github.com/bradtiltonnow/simple-todo/).

My goal for this component was to create something that works with lots of opportunities for enhancements, so check the issues for enhancement ideas or add some of your own.
